to maybe make a start from an OEM perspective for device statuses I can think of (off the cuff, not complete list):device status: booting, sleep, standby, active, shutdownpower status: supply nominal, supply problem (voltage too low/too high)link status: link established, link lostcharging status: disconnected, negotiating, connected and charging, connected but not charging (e.g. battery full)They don't have to all be within this one STATUS flag array, but it may be useful to have a unified summary across devices
